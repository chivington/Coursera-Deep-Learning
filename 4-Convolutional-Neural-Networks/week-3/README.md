Assignments and projects for week three of [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks).


## Learning Objectives
* Understand the challenges of Object Localization, Object Detection and Landmark Finding.
* Understand and implement non-max suppression.
* Understand and implement intersection over union.
* Understand how we label a dataset for an object detection application.
* Remember the vocabulary of object detection (landmark, anchor, bounding box, grid, ...).
