Assignments and projects for week three of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). This is the first course of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

# Learning Objectives
* Understand hidden units and hidden layers
* Be able to apply a variety of activation functions in a neural network.
* Build your first forward and backward propagation with a hidden layer
* Apply random initialization to your neural network
* Become fluent with Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
* Build and train a neural network with one hidden layer.
