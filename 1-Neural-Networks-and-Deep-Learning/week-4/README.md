Assignments and projects for week four of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning).

## Learning Objectives
* See deep neural networks as successive blocks put one after each other
* Build and train a deep L-layer Neural Network
* Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations.
* Understand how to use a cache to pass information from forward propagation to back propagation.
* Understand the role of hyperparameters in deep learning
