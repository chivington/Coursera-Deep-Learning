Assignments and projects for week one of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). This is the first course of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
* Be able to explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning.
* Understand what are the major categories of models (such as CNNs and RNNs), and when they should be applied.
* Be able to recognize the basics of when deep learning will (or will not) work well.
