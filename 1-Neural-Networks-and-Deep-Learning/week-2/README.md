Assignments and projects for week two of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning).

## Learning Objectives
* Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network
* Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
* Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
* Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
* Become familiar with Python and Numpy
* Work with iPython Notebooks
* Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples
